- Retrofit w/ Gson →
    - This one was used to make API calls and parse the json to data classes automatically
- Glide →
    - A very image loading library for news images

    - This was used to remove the tedious jo of getting country codes and validating → [https://github.com/hbb20/CountryCodePickerProject](https://github.com/hbb20/CountryCodePickerProject)
- Times formatter →
    - Formatting the published time to time difference {pretty niche use case but made life much easier}
- Android custom tabs →
    - Loading the news url in web views {wasn’t part of the requirements but felt incomplete without it}
- Splash compat library →
    - Recently shifted to release candidate, this library makes the sweet sweet Android 12 splash screens available for older devices.
- Other jetpack libraries like Lifecycle component or kotlin libraries like coroutines.
